                                                President Trump has spent a big part of his presidency building upon the anti-immigrant hate he put forward when he degraded Mexicans as rapists and drug smugglers at his campaign launch. Last October, as thousands of Central American migrants made their way to our southern border to seek asylum, Trump tweeted, in part, “This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!”.                                                                        </p>

                                        There is many ways you can help your local immigrant community. I am going to list a few things you can do to welcome them into your community. The first way is to host a supper club, you will bring eachother together throuh your meals. Call your state and federal represenatives, tell them that the immigrants in your community are valued members of it and that our country should live up to its values and remain a welcoming place.
